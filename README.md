# AI-Powered Career Recommendations and Resume Screener

## 📌 Overview

Many students struggle with career decisions due to a lack of personalized guidance on suitable job roles, required skills, and industry trends. Additionally, optimizing resumes to align with employer expectations is a challenge. This project aims to develop an **AI-powered career guidance and resume optimization system** to help students make informed career choices and improve their job application success rates.

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Personalized Career Recommendations
- 📊 Analyze academic performance, interests, skills, and market trends.
- 🛤️ Suggest suitable career paths (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Researcher, etc.).
- 🎓 Recommend relevant courses, certifications, and projects to enhance employability.
- 🌍 Ensure career path alignment with current industry trends.

### 2️⃣ AI Resume Screener and Optimizer
- 📄 Evaluate a student's resume based on job descriptions.
- ✍️ Suggest improvements in formatting, keywords, and content.
- 🎯 Generate tailored resume versions for different job applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js / FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Machine Learning**: Python (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, NLP)
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS / GCP / Docker

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Students provide details about their education, skills, interests, and job preferences.
2. **AI Analysis**: The system processes the input, analyzing career trends and job market demands.
3. **Recommendations**: Users receive personalized career guidance and project/course suggestions.
4. **Resume Optimization**: The AI assesses and enhances the user’s resume based on job descriptions.

## 🖥️ Backend Code (FastAPI + Machine Learning)

### 📌 Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas scikit-learn nltk openai

📌 Backend API (app.py)

from fastapi import FastAPI
from recommendation import get_career_recommendations
from resume_optimizer import optimize_resume

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Welcome to AI-Powered Career Guidance API"}

@app.post("/career-recommendation/")
def career_recommendation(user_data: dict):
    return get_career_recommendations(user_data)

@app.post("/resume-optimization/")
def resume_optimization(resume_text: dict):
    return optimize_resume(resume_text["content"])

📌 Career Recommendation Logic (recommendation.py)

import random

def get_career_recommendations(user_data):
    skills = user_data.get("skills", [])
    interests = user_data.get("interests", [])
    
    career_paths = {
        "Software Engineer": ["Python", "Java", "C++", "Web Development"],
        "Data Scientist": ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Statistics"],
        "AI Researcher": ["Deep Learning", "Neural Networks", "NLP"],
        "Cybersecurity Analyst": ["Network Security", "Penetration Testing"]
    }

    matches = [career for career, required_skills in career_paths.items() if any(skill in skills for skill in required_skills)]
    
    return {"recommended_careers": matches if matches else ["General IT Career"]}
